# Calculator
A custom calculator which supports expression evaluations, and implements a simple variable system.

## How to use?
Run in the terminal using `gcc main.c -o a -lm` and then `./a`

`>>>>>` is intended to mock Python interactive UI, which might be a little more user-friendly.

## Supported Operation
 - `+`: addition
 - `-`: subtraction
 - `*`: multiplication
 - `/`: float division
 - `^`: power
 - `()`: braces
 - and **variable system** (variables must be **initialized** before using)
